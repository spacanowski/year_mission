Bash calculator for calculating year mission stats

#What is "Year mission" ?

Year mission is a mission. Mission to run/bike/swim/ride/travel a distance in given year.

Let me give you an example: let's assume that now is year 2015. Missions in this year is to run/bike/swim/ride/travel (whatever gives you motivation) 2015 km.

This simple script lets you calculate if you are behind schedule (the debt), how many kms are left and how many km you will need to do every day to make it.

#Usage
In shell console go to script dir and type:
```
 ./year_mission.sh 1000
```

where 1000 is km you already make in this year
You will get:
```
debt:
675.04
km left to goal:
1014
needs km per day:
16.62
```

This is for year 2014.
debt means you are 675.04 km behind schedule
Rest is pretty clear.
